 <h2 class="wiki_unbold">Clio failure during exposure (May 2010)</h2> 
 <div class="level2"> 
  <p>The program would occasionally fail to complete an exposure. This was tracked down to a memory allocation problem during bootup. The driver memory allocation for the LEach PCI card was not consistent with the remaining amount of meory allocated in the system.</p> 
  <p></p> 
  <p>The display does not properly subtract the background when a coadded frame is shown. Fixed. 091228</p> 
  <p>Clio Motor control does not toggle between “Advanced” and “Simple” correctly. Fixed 100525</p> 
  <p>A “Take Background” should only take 1-3 frames, not 10. Fixed 091228. Should now take 2.</p>
  <p>A serial cable extension needs to be attached to the temperature cable to prevent it being knocked off during packing. fixed 100520<br class="" /></p></div>
