 <p>Edit this page with any requests for modifications to the Clio software. Changes will be made based on how awesome your idea is. Sign your initials or name so I can contact you if necessary.</p>
 <p>Requests:</p>
 <p>-Don't turn off Clio motors power continuously during a &quot;move motors&quot; move; rather, keep power on, and turn off power at the end. (TJR)</p>
 <p>-Engineering mode vs. Observing mode (AW)</p>
 <p>-Entry fields should either automatically update with text entered (without pressing return), or should turn red if return hasn't been pressed and the user clicks away. (AW)</p>
 <p>-AutoStar shouldn't require the user to tell Clio where the star is..this information is already known, so AutoStar should just need to know where you want to move the star. (TJR)</p>
 <p>-User should be able to select the &quot;Scale&quot; button after moving the collimator lens (wheel 6) during alignment, as opposed to having to click &quot;Next CW&quot;. (TJR)</p></div>
