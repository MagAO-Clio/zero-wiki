 <ol>
<li>Remove the SDSU electronics from the cryostat. Unplug enough of the cables attached to it, so that it can be set aside.</li>
<li>Remove the 8-32 screws holding the front case on with a 9/64 ball driver.</li>
<li>Slowly open the gold vacuum valve to allow air into Clio. If available, back fill with nitrogen.</li>
<li>Remove the cover. You now have access to the vacuum area of Clio. Use gloves for handling any equipment that is exposed to the vacuum to minimize oil from your hands compromising the vacuum cleanliness. </li>
<li>Remove the 4-40 screws with the 3/32 ball driver. Remove outer and inner radiation shield covers when all the screws have been removed.</li>
<li>The O-rings and shield covers should be stored so that the are kept as clean as possible. </li>
<li>Remove the wires labeled "3" and "4" from the filter wheel box.</li>
<li>Loosen the couplings attaching the shafts for filter wheels 1 and 2 (labeled 3 and 4), and the pupil box 2. Slide the couplings away from the filter wheel box so that the gap between the shafts is visible. The right side requires a small allen key (0.035").</li>
<li>Loosen the screws on the pupil box, to provide space for the filter box to slide out.</li>
<li>Remove filter box from Clio. Find a clean workplace to work on it.</li>
<li>Filter wheel 1 is accessed by removing the "shiny" bare aluminum side of the box, Filter wheel 2 is accessed from the black side, through a circular port.</li>
<li>Consult <a href="52ac4/Filters.html">Filters Info</a> for current filters. Update this list as you are working to make sure the list stays current.</li>
<li>Remember that for FW2, the counterclockwise motion of the wheel as you are looking at it corresponds to the direction of numbering in filter information.</li>
<li>Loosen the 3 screws holding the brass tabs. BE CAREFUL to hold the screw driver to avoid scratching the filters. Don't apply downward pressure on the screw.</li>
<li>Tilt the box over to remove the filter. Place a new filter in with a spacer that is marginally thicker than the receptacle. You may need to bend the brass tabs up to hold the assembly in place. You want the springiness of the tabs to hold the filter in, bend them up or downward as needed to achieve this.</li>
<li>Reinsert the filter box, making sure to keep the pupil box loose, so that the filter box can be leaned away from the detector board, as it is inserted.</li>
<li>Reattach the couplings on each bellows shaft. Line the screws up with the flattened off side on each shaft.</li>
<li>Test movement of the wheel by external manual movement of the motors to verify proper coupling.</li>
<li>Clean the O-ring and shield covers to ensure good vacuum seal (ask Mauricio Navarrate to help), using canned air under the O-ring, and wiping the shield covers with isopropyl alcohol.</li>
<li>Replace the shield covers, looking for the "M" on the cover to line up with the "M" on the shield wall lip.</li>
<li>Replace the case cover, making sure to line up the red tape triangles, on the top.</li>
