<p>Several tasks are only needed during the first night of a Clio run. These include:</p>
<p> </p>
<ul>
<li>Cold Stop Alignment</li>
<li>Focusing of Clio</li>
</ul>
<h2>Cold Stop Alignment</h2>
<div>
<ul>
<li>The camera lens brass knob is turned counterclockwise 1 detent to put in the pupil imaging lens (setting 1).</li>
<li>The pupil wheel should be surveyed to find the f/20 stop. </li>
<li>Adjust the f/20 stop to center on the secondary image using the Advanced Options in the Clio Motor Control dialog. For more details see the section on <a href="d9496/Using_the_APP_mode_of_Clio.html">using the APP mode</a>. See images of below for proper alignment.</li>
<li>If orthogonal adjustment is needed this must be manually with shims at the instrument.</li>
<li>Return the Camera lens to f/20 imaging with a clockwise turn of the brass knob.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Focusing of Clio</h2></div>
<div>The focus of the Clio camera is adjusted by changing the position of the AO WFS. </div>
<div>
<ul>
<li>Close the AO loop</li>
<li>Adjust the WFSC position in 10-20 micron increments by asking the AO operator.</li>
<li>Monitor the peak brightness of the star, and maximize it.</li>
</ul>
<div>Once you have set this, the AO will keep Clio focused throughout the run.</div></div>
