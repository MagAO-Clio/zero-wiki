<h1>CLIO2 Support Agreement</h1>

<div class="writeboardbody">
  <h1><span class="caps">DRAFT</span> 2012-04-07</h1>
<h1>1 Instrument Description</h1>
<p>Clio2 is a 1-5 micron imager, and coronagraph built to exploit the unique sensitivity and resolution of deformable secondary AO systems. A particular area of focus for the instrument is to provide sensitive detection of giant planets at 3.3, 3.8 and 4.8 microns. Clio2 uses a 512&#215;1024 <span class="caps">HAWAII</span>-1 array.</p>
<p>The instrument was designed and built by a team at Steward Observatory including Melanie Freed, Andy Breuninger, Ari Heinze, Suresh Sivanandam, and Phil Hinz.  Information about its operation on the <span class="caps">MMT</span> can be found at</p>
<p>http://zero.as.arizona.edu/groups/clio2usermanual/</p>
<h1>2 Configuration</h1>
<h2>The following information will be provided relating to the telescope/instrument configuration:</h2>
<p>2.1 <em>Specify the intended port</em></p>
<ul>
	<li>Clio2 is mounted on the Clay Nasmyth East port on the Magellan AO <span class="caps">NAS</span> ring (not the usual Magellan guider).</li>
</ul>
<p>2.2 <em>Specify the secondary mirror and <span class="caps">ADC</span>:</em></p>
<ul>
	<li>Magellan f/16 <span class="caps">ASM</span>, no <span class="caps">ADC</span></li>
</ul>
<p>2.3 <em>Provisions for guiding: Does the instrument require one of the observatory guiders and, if so, specify which model?</em></p>
<ul>
	<li>One Magellan guider/S-H assembly is built into the Magellan AO <span class="caps">NAS</span> ring.</li>
</ul>
<p>2.4 <em>Specify instrument size and weight:</em></p>
<p>The instrument cryostat with attached motors is an envelope 30 inches high, 26 inches deep, and 30 inches wide.</p>
<p>The instrument weighs approximately 50-60 lbs., or 120 lbs. including the mount.</p>
<p>2.5 <em>List size and location of instrument racks, compressors, and other equipment.</em></p>
<p>The Clio instrument is configured with an electronics rack that houses the power supplies, instrument server, and network switches. The rack can be thermally controlled with glycol.  It is designed to operate on the floor of the E. Nasmyth platform approximately 25 ft from the <span class="caps">NAS</span>. The rack model is <strong><span class="caps">TBD</span></strong> .</p>
<p>2.6 <em>Description and location of the control console. Is this dedicated equipment or shared with other instruments?</em></p>
<p>The Clio instrument can be controlled locally via a rack mounted monitor at the electronics support rack or remotely via ssh access using  remote X display. Typical operations are via the remote interface.</p>
<p>2.7 <em>Discuss telescope and rotator balance considerations.</em></p>
<p>The instrument is light, but is not centered on the rotator access.  We anticipate counterweights will be needed to balance the instrument, which will be built in to the ring.</p>
<p>Clio is currently designed to only allow +/- 90 degree rotation.  This is being remedied and will be demonstrated prior to shipment.  Solid nitrogen is used for detector cooling and can operate at any orientation.  The modification will either involve solidifying the nitrogen in the outer vessel, or modifying the outer vessel to have a &#8220;straw&#8221; within the canister.  Final details/demo. will be presented at the pre-ship review.</p>
<p>2.8 <em>Specify special baffle requirements.</em></p>
<ul>
	<li>No special baffles are required.</li>
</ul>
<p>2.9 <em>Cable description and layout. State if the cables are permanently installed and if they are shared with other instruments. Is a cable wrap required?</em></p>
<p>Clio has a dedicated control cable bundle which supplies all required electric, signal, and control services. The cable bundle emanates from the Clio electronics rack and terminates at the instrument. The cable bundle is approximately 25 ft in length.</p>
<p>No cable wrap is required.  A cable strain relief will be fabricated at the center of the instrument rotation to provide cable management fromt he cryostat to the electronics rack.</p>
<h1>3 Service requirements</h1>
<h2>The following information will be provided related to controls, utilities, and cabling:</h2>
<p>3.1 <em>Requirements for power, compressed air, and coolant.</em></p>
<p>110VAC, 20 amps.</p>
<p>We will need coolant sufficient to dissipate ~500 W.</p>
<p>3.2 <em>Requirements for heat extraction.</em></p>
<p>The Clio electronics rack generates approximately 500 W of heat which will need to be extracted by facility coolant.</p>
<p>3.3 <em>Requirements for cryogens.</em></p>
<p>The instrument is cooled with LN2. The LN2 reservoir is filled at the fill port located at the top of the reservoir vessel. The reservoir capacity is 9 liters. The hold time for the outer vessel is approximately 24 hours, requiring refill of the outer vessel of ~ 4 liters.  The hold time for the inner vessel is not certain, but we typically refill every ~4 days.</p>
<p>The hold time may change after upgrade of the system to be rotatable over 360 degrees.</p>
<h1>4 Routine Support</h1>
<h2>The following information regarding routine operation of the instrument will be provided:</h2>
<p>4.1 <em>Description of the routine servicing and periodic maintenance that will be performed by the Observatory Staff both when the instrument is on and off the telescope.</em></p>
<p>Daily cryogen servicing.<br />
Vacuum pumping prior to observation campaign, using facility turbo pump.<br />
Routine Getter baking (roughly annually).</p>
<p>4.2 <em>Technical personnel required for operation and an estimated amount of time they will regularly devote to the instrument.</em></p>
<p>Tasks <del>-</del> on-site Instrument Specialist:<br />
1)  Installation, mounting and instrument checkout (4 hours per campaign)<br />
2) Daily cryogen fills (15 minutes per fill) <del>-</del> documented in the daily reporting<br />
3) Local help for troubleshooting (Occasional check of cables/electronics)<br />
4) Mechanical technician for installation and mounting</p>
<p>4.3 <em>Consumable supplies required for operations with estimated quantities.</em></p>
<ul>
	<li>Liquid nitrogen, quantity 6 liters per day of operation + 15 liters for cooldown.</li>
</ul>
<p>4.4 <em>Power, air, and coolant requirements.</em></p>
<p>Same as 3.1</p>
<p>4.5 <em>Description of the procedures required for routine instrument changes. These include pump down and cool down procedures, cabling, power up, filter and mask preparation, preparation of the data system, and actual start-up procedures. Actual handling procedures are described in a later section.</em></p>
<p>Detailed written procedures <del>-</del> refer to procedural document (checklist)</p>
<ul>
	<li>Before cooling, Clio should be put on the turbopump. Pumping with a turbopump or similar system is required for 24 hours prior to cooling.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li>Clio needs 12 hours to completely cool down to a stable temperature. The detector is operational 6 hours after cooldown. If possible, it is thus preferable to begin cooldown the day before the Clio run starts.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li>Only the outer vessel is filled for the first fill, and this takes typically 10 minutes to get the cooling down going. Fill until the liquid spurts out of the tube.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li>Look for the vapor to stop exiting from Clio after about 30 minutes. This is an indication the liquid has boiled off. Refill the outer vessel a second time. It should be empty after around 3 hours from the start of your cooldown. Refill a third time.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li>When the outer vessel temperature is 150 degrees or below, you can fill the inner vesel. The limit of 150 degrees is important, as this is the temperature that the getter in the dewar activates. Do not fill the inner vessel if the outer vessel is above 150 K! If the detector is the coldest surface in the dewar, the detector will attract all residual vapours!</li>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li>Align the cold stop<br />
  Twilight sky is needed for this.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li>Close the AO loop</li>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li>Focus Clio2</li>
</ul>
<p>*Setup information will be kept up to date at http://zero.as.arizona.edu/groups/clio2usermanual/<br />
with a local clone at <span class="caps">LCO</span></p>
<p>4.6 <em>Requirements for status reports from the support staff to the instrument group. Here the instrument groups would specify what feed back they expect from <span class="caps">LCO</span> on the operation and performance of the instrument.</em></p>
<p>*Support staff should document the cryogen fills on <span class="caps">JIRA</span> daily reporting</p>
<p>*Trouble reports should be provide to the instrument group.</p>
<p>4.7 <em>Instrument mailing list and the names of its members.</em></p>
<p>Currently there is no mailing list.</p>
