<p>The Clio prism is a direct-vision design prism, which means it has three wedges that make up the overall prism. The undeviated wavelength is 2 microns. Because it is a prism (not a grating) the dispersion is nonlinear. </p>
<h2>Spectral Resolution</h2>
<p>The spectral resolution as a function of wavelength for a 0.2" image is</p>

<h2>Wavelength Solution</h2>
<div>The nonlinear dispersion of the direct vision prism is well fit by a quadratic equation with wavelength as the independent variable. Fitting the ZEMAX model image positions, expressed in pixels, and solving the quadratic give s the wavelength solution of:</div>
